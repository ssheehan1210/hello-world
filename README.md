My first repository

Hello there!

My name is Sam and after over two years of working at a digital consultancy firm as a sourcing specialist, I'm finally taking the plunge into becoming a true web developer!
I like learning about new technology in the digital space, keeping up with developments in the video game industry, and making sure I get my daily dose of coffee in the morning (thanks a lot for getting me hooked, Chicago).
